    <h1>ROBOTS</h1>
    <p1>A robot is a machine—especially one programmable
        by a computer— capable of carrying out a
        complex series of actions automatically.
        Robots can be guided by an external control device
        or the control may be embedded within. Robots may
        be constructed on the lines of human form, but most
        robots are machines designed to perform a task with
        no regard to their aesthetics.</p1>
    <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
    <p2>The word robot can refer to both physical robots
        and virtual software agents, but the latter are
        usually referred to as bots.[13] There is no
        consensus on which machines qualify as robots
        but there is general agreement among experts,
        and the public, that robots tend to possess
        some or all of the following abilities and
        functions: accept electronic programming,
        process data or physical perceptions
        electronically, operate autonomously
        to some degree, move around, operate
        physical parts of itself or physical
        processes, sense and manipulate their
        environment, and exhibit intelligent
        behavior, especially behavior which mimics
        humans or other animals.[14][15] Closely
        related to the concept of a robot is the
        field of Synthetic Biology,
        which studies entities whose nature
        is more comparable to beings than
        to machines.</p2>
    <h3>History</h3>
    <p3>The idea of automata originates in the
        mythologies of many cultures around the
        world. Engineers and inventors from ancient
        civilizations, including Ancient China,
        [16] Ancient Greece, and Ptolemaic Egypt,
        [17] attempted to build self-operating machines,
        some resembling animals and humans.
        Early descriptions of automata include the artificial
        doves of Archytas,[18] the artificial birds of Mozi
        and Lu Ban,[19] a "speaking" automaton by Hero of
        Alexandria, a washstand automaton by Philo
        of Byzantium, and a human automaton described
        in the Lie Zi.[16]</p3>
    <h4>Early robots</h4>
    <p4>In 1928, one of the first humanoid robots, Eric,
        was exhibited at the annual exhibition of the Model Engineers
        Society in London, where it delivered a speech.
        Invented by W. H. Richards, the robot's frame consisted of an
        aluminium body of armour with eleven electromagnets
        and one motor powered by a twelve-volt power source.
        The
        robot could move its hands and head and could be controlled
        through remote control or voice control.[50] Both
        Eric and his "brother" George toured the world.[51]</p4>
    <h5>Modern autonomous robots</h5>
    <p5>The first electronic autonomous robots with complex
        behaviour were created by William Grey Walter of the Burden
        Neurological Institute at Bristol, England in 1948
        and 1949. He wanted to prove that rich connections between a
        small number of brain cells could give rise to very
        complex behaviors – essentially that the secret of how the
        brain worked lay in how it was wired up. His first robots,
        named Elmer and Elsie, were constructed between 1948
        and 1949 and were often described as tortoises due to their
        shape and slow rate of movement. The three-wheeled
        tortoise robots were capable of phototaxis, by which they
        could find their way to a recharging station when they
        ran low on battery power.</p5>
